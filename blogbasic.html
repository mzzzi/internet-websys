Virgo - Fragile Bird <br>
“If I look perfect, and do everything perfectly, I can avoid or minimize the painful feelings of shame, judgment, and blame.” - Brenne Browne
An emphasised focus of the Virgo’s journey is the purification process. Virgo is the sign of cleansing and detoxing. A proportionate part of the Virgo nature relentlessly and tirelessly attempts to erode their sense of shame. The ego finished construction in Leo, and it certainly wasn’t built to last. It faces its first conflict in Virgo. After the glare and applause of Leo the star was discarded. And Virgo is suddenly overwrought with guilt, like the lights have gone out and the whole time they didn’t hear anyone suffering. Now it seems to be all that the Virgo can hear. It becomes important for Virgo to develop awareness of the world beyond the ‘only me seeing eye’ produced in Leo. Instead of seeking the acclaim of centre stage, the individual takes a step back and retreats to the back of the show. Virgo can feel so consumed with shame and disgrace that she decides out of sight is out of mind, and attempt to remain invisible as possible. Virgo is a sign associated with responsibility, self discipline, and self regulation. The Virgo can feel intense and disproportionate shame for the most mundane of human activities like eating, sleeping in, or accidentally spilling something. There is an ego fighting wildly in Virgo, aware of its inevitable departure.

Cancer - Accomplished one <br>
Cancers need to feel family-like acceptance everywhere. they appreciate significantly when you remember little details about them, like how they have their coffee
when you tell cancers you are having a difficult time and you are sad and worried they will take your problems to bed with them and stay up all night for you. it’s like cancers hold people’s troubles over night for them so they can sleep soundly.
Expresses emotional and maternal qualities, often moody, easily provoked, imaginative, and nostalgic
The Cancer character is protective. She could be a psychic or receive messages from crossed ancestors.
Likes wearing darker hues. Maybe also a cross. A character who may be lost in time or attempting to run or heal from her past, one who makes admirable sacrifices. This character prefers to be home with loved ones and retains traditional values. She may live in a house the family has had for decades, probably haunted. Very caring and sensitive, could be a nurse, counsellor, or work with children. A character who has a vivid and intriguing inner life that is shut off to others. A character who is reuniting with her family or meeting her mother for the first time.
